# OpenGL-based Ray Tracing Model

The OpenGL-based Ray Tracing Model is a sophisticated rendering tool that leverages ray tracing techniques to achieve high-quality and realistic image synthesis. By combining the power of OpenGL and ray tracing algorithms, this project delivers stunning visuals and accurate lighting simulations.

This Project is derived from MSU CSE 472 project1.
